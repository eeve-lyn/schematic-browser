Schematic Browser has been implemented in [Foo's Client](https://github.com/mindustry-antigrief/mindustry-client/) and improved in [Schematic Browser Reworked](https://github.com/sbxte/mindustry-schematic-browser). Use those instead, my JS code is nasty.

# schematic-browser
Mod which allows the player to download schematics online from various repositories.
